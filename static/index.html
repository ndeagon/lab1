	<!-- p means paragraph -->
	<p> Nick is a computer science student at UCSD. He is in his third year. On his free time, he participates and programs in an on campus organization called TritonTV. He is currently developing a web-app to check out the clubs equipment to its members from the ground up, using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. </p>

	<h4>Here's a bit about my current project...</h4>
	<p>
	I have a team working with me to put the site together. The styling is mostly done with bootstrap.<img src="img1.png"align="middle"style="width:608px;height:456px;">

	<p><img src="img2.png" style="width:988px;height:489px;"align="middle"> It's still a work in progress... </p>
